This Dataset contains the step-by-step process of building a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict Customer Churn based on provided information form the dataset. The dataset used in this project was collected from the Datacamp course

What is customer churn?
It is when an existing customer, user, player, subscriber or any kind of return client stops doing business or ends the relationship with a company.

The goal of this project is to Design a Decision Tree Classifier and tune it to predict if a customer will churn or not.
